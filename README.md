# This is the Back-end of a Hostel booking system created using Java.

This Back end allows for users to see hostels available in our database and allows for them to book one based on their preference, i.e; Self-contained, Non-self contained, double or a single bedroom

This backend is hooked up with a front-end which you might check out here: https://github.com/Izaiah-M/Hostel-Booking-App
